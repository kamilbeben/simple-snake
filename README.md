# snakeMapEditor

Hello, you can download this game on your android device for free there: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beben.simplesnake

This is my first completed project on android, and i've learned a lot coding this. Now i know that i should put every maps in separate files using simple pattern like this (for example):
111111
100001
100001
111111
and then load them in program, but month ago i didn't knew things like i do now, and i know that my code is probably very obsolete, you don't have to tell me this :)
